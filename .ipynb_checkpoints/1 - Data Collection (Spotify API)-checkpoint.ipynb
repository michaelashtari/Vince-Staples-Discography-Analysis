    "# Introduction/Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome! This notebook is the first installation in a series of 3 Jupyter notebooks (and one .py script for the interactive dashboard) that will encompass the *Vince Staples Audio Feature Analysis* data project. In essence, this project is a means to showcase the data science learnings I've gained through my studies, with the purpose being to query and acquire a dataset, parse through it and perform some exploratory data analysis, and ultimately employ some machine learning methodology, if deemed appropriate, to extrapolate insights from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "While scouring through the plethora of interesting datasets available on the internet, I came across Spotify's public-facing web API, through which anyone can gain access to interesting data surrounding artists, tracks, albums, etc. Most notably, we're capable of acquiring very interesting metadata for musical tracks, particularly numerical audio features that help quantify key characteristics of musical tracks. Being a massive hip-hop enthusiast myself, I was enticed by the idea of taking one of my favorite artist's Spotify tracks - in this case, the renowned rap artist *Vince Staples* - and performing some analysis and visualization using those numerical audio features - hence this project was born. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, the first step in this data exploration exercise is to actually retrieve the data. As implied by the title, this notebook is solely concerned with the data acquisition step. More information and discussion regarding the feature analysis and machine learning implementation can be found in the subsequent notebooks, but for now let's concern ourselves with pulling the data using Spotify's API, and preparing the data into a format that will be amenable to our analysis in later steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I've obviously decided a priori that the pertinent artist for whom I'll be pulling the track data will be *Vince Staples*, for the sake of reproducibility I've structured the code in this notebook (not necessarily the commentary in the markdown) in such a manner that we could easily perform the same data pull for any other musical artist. We would only need to modify the artist string passed as a parameter to our GET queries, defined in step 2 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Official documentation regarding how to work with Spotify's web API, which I used to guide me through the steps below, can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/client-credentials/). Additionally, I would like to acknowledge the CodingEntrepreneurs channel on YouTube for creating an amazingly clear and helpful video that walks through how to authorize calls to the API and work with the tool in Python, which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/xdq6Gz33khQ). I highly recommend that anyone interested in understanding/reproducing this work visit their YouTube video, because I would not have been able to accomplish the data acquisition step as seamlessly without it!"

Notice from albums_df that the maximum number of tracks in any given album in Vince's discography is 20, from Summertime '06, which just so happens to coincide with the default number of results returned. Regardless, we'll specify this parameter to be explicit (and to encourage code reusability). Note that the maximum possible value for limit is 50. If for some reason there were more than 50 tracks in an album (perhaps in non-musical volumes), we'd need to adjust our code to perform repeated queries that also specify an offset (the index of our first search result) for our response, so that we could retrieve all pages of results."
